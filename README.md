## üß† Overview

Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow that impairs the normal production and function of white blood cells. Accurate and early classification of leukemia subtypes is crucial for effective treatment planning and prognosis. With advancements in bioinformatics, RNA-Seq gene expression profiling offers a data-rich source for computational disease modeling.

In this project, we apply various supervised machine learning models to predict the type of leukemia based on gene expression features. Our goal is to evaluate multiple algorithms for performance and interpretability, ultimately identifying the most effective method for this biomedical classification task.

## üîÅ Project Workflow

This project follows a standard ML pipeline adapted for biomedical data:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Cleaning
- Load the CuMiDa dataset into a DataFrame
- Handle missing values and verify class distributions
- Drop irrelevant or constant features if present

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize class balance
- Plot gene expression distributions using boxplots and histograms
- Use correlation heatmaps to assess feature relationships

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- Encode categorical labels into numerical values
- Scale features using `StandardScaler` for uniform input

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets
- Train multiple classification models
- Use consistent seeds and evaluation splits for reproducibility

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning
- Apply `GridSearchCV` to optimize model parameters
- Validate using 5-fold cross-validation (optional for small data)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Evaluate models on test data using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix
- Compare performance across all models

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance
- Use XGBoost‚Äôs `plot_importance()` to rank gene features
- Interpret which genes contribute most to predictions

## ü§ñ Models Used

We implemented and compared the following classification algorithms:

| Model                 | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | A linear classifier used as a baseline |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Distance-based classification using nearest data points |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble learning with decision trees |
| **XGBoost** | Gradient Boosted Trees optimized for performance and interpretability |

Each model was trained and evaluated under consistent conditions for fair comparison.

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

We assessed each model using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy** ‚Äì Percentage of correct predictions
- **Confusion Matrix** ‚Äì Counts of TP, FP, TN, FN for each class
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score** ‚Äì Class-specific performance
- **AUC-ROC** ‚Äì Area under the ROC curve for multi-class classification
- **XGBoost Feature Importance** ‚Äì Gene-level contribution to predictions

Visual plots (heatmaps, confusion matrices, ROC curves) are saved in `/plots/`.

## üìä Results
Model	Accuracy	AUC-ROC
Logistic Regression	94%	0.97
KNN	91%	0.94
Random Forest	96%	0.99
XGBoost	98%	1.00

üö® Note: 100% AUC may suggest overfitting. More data and cross-validation recommended.
